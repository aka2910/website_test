    I inadvertently went to See's Candy last week (I was in the mall looking for phone repair), and as it turns out,
    See's Candy now charges a dollar -- a full dollar -- for even the simplest of their wee confection offerings. I
    bought two chocolate lollipops and two chocolate-caramel-almond things. The total cost was four-something. I mean,
    the candies were tasty and all, but let's be real: A Snickers bar is fifty cents. After this dollar-per-candy
    revelation, I may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a See's Candy any time soon.

    You can decide what you want to do in life, but I suggest doing something that creates. Something that leaves a
    tangible thing once you're done. That way even after you're gone, you will still live on in the things you created.

    The boy walked down the street in a carefree way, playing without notice of what was about him. He didn't hear the
    sound of the car as his ball careened into the road. He took a step toward it, and in doing so sealed his fate.

    The amber droplet hung from the branch, reaching fullness and ready to drop. It waited. While many of the other
    droplets were satisfied to form as big as they could and release, this droplet had other plans. It wanted to be part
    of history. It wanted to be remembered long after all the other droplets had dissolved into history. So it waited
    for the perfect specimen to fly by to trap and capture that it hoped would eventually be discovered hundreds of
    years in the future.

    At that moment he had a thought that he'd never imagine he'd consider. "I could just cheat," he thought, "and that
    would solve the problem." He tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent. It didn't want to go away and,
    if he was honest with himself, he didn't want it to.
